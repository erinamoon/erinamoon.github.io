I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student in the Faculty of Information at the University of Toronto. I am advised by [Dr. Shion Guha](https://shionguha.ca). I am a member of the [Human-Centred Data Science Lab](https://hcds-uoft.ca) and a Junior Fellow at [Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca). 

In my research, I explore decision-making in public sociotechnical systems and the ramifications of introducing AI in these domains.

I hold a Master of Information from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Chicago.
