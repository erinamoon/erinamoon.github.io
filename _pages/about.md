I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. I work at the [Human-Centred Data Science Lab](https://hcds-uoft.ca) under Dr. Shion Guha and I am also a Junior Fellow at [Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca). 

I hold a Master of Information from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Chicago.
