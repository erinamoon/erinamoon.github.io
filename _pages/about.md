I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. I work at the [Human-Centred Data Science Lab](https://hcds-uoft.ca) under Dr. Shion Guha and I am also a Junior Fellow at [Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca). 

In my research, I explore decision-making in sociotechnical systems and the ramifications of introducing AI or similar data-driven systems in these domains. I am deeply interested in understanding how data and technology are used/can be used in Toronto's homeless support systems.

I hold a Master of Information from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Chicago. 

## Research News
- Our paper “Rethinking “Risk” in Algorithmic Systems Through A Computational Narrative Analysis of Casenotes in Child-Welfare” was accepted at CHI’2023 and received the Best Paper Award 
- I attended the Human-Centered AI (HCAI) workshop at NeurIPS’22 [position paper](https://erinamoon.github.io/files/Future_for_AIGovernance.pdf)
- Our paper “Unpacking Invisible Work Practices, Constraints, and Latent Power Relationships in Child Welfare through Casenote Analysis” has been accepted to CHI’2022. This paper offers the first computational analysis of child-welfare casenotes using NLP techniques and introduces them as a critical data source.
