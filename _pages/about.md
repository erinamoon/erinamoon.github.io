I am a 2nd year Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. I work at the [Human-Centred Data Science Lab](https://hcds-uoft.ca) under Dr. Shion Guha and I am also a Junior Fellow at [Massey College](https://www.masseycollege.ca). 

In my research, I explore decision-making in sociotechnical systems and the ramifications of introducing AI in these domains. I am deeply interested in working closely with communities in Toronto to understand data and technology use in Toronto's homeless support systems.

I hold a Master of Information from the University of Toronto and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from the University of Chicago.
